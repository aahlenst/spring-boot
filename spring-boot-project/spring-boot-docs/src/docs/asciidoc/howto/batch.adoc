== Batch Applications
A number of questions often arise when people use Spring Batch from within a Spring Boot application.
This section addresses those questions.

[[howto.batch.architectural-considerations]]
=== Architectural Considerations

The default configuration of Spring Batch is geared towards single-job containerized Spring Boot apps orchestrated by a job scheduler like Kubernetes, optionally using https://dataflow.spring.io/[Spring Cloud Dataflow]:

* *All* `Jobs` in the application context are executed once on application startup, see <<#howto.batch.running-jobs-on-startup>>.
* Jobs are run on the same thread they are launched on.

It is also a valid option to run batch jobs as part of other applications, notably web applications running in servlet containers.
Example use cases include reporting, ad-hoc job running, and web application support.
See {spring-batch-docs}job.html#runningJobsFromWebContainer for how to do this.
Furthermore, you might need to <<#howto.batch.customizing-task-executor,customize the task executor for batch jobs>>.



[[howto.batch.specifying-a-data-source]]
=== Specifying a Batch Data Source
By default, batch applications require a `DataSource` to store job details.
Spring Batch expects a single `DataSource` by default.
To have it use a `DataSource` other than the applicationâ€™s main `DataSource`, declare a `DataSource` bean, annotating its `@Bean` method with `@BatchDataSource`.
If you do so and want two data sources, remember to mark the other one `@Primary`.
To take greater control, implement `BatchConfigurer`.
See {spring-batch-api}/core/configuration/annotation/EnableBatchProcessing.html[The Javadoc of `@EnableBatchProcessing`] for more details.

For more info about Spring Batch, see the {spring-batch}[Spring Batch project page].



[[howto.batch.running-jobs-on-startup]]
=== Running Spring Batch Jobs on Startup
Spring Batch auto-configuration is enabled by adding `@EnableBatchProcessing` to one of your `@Configuration` classes.

By default, it executes *all* `Jobs` in the application context on startup (see {spring-boot-autoconfigure-module-code}/batch/JobLauncherApplicationRunner.java[`JobLauncherApplicationRunner`] for details).
You can narrow down to a specific job or jobs by specifying `spring.batch.job.names` (which takes a comma-separated list of job name patterns).

See {spring-boot-autoconfigure-module-code}/batch/BatchAutoConfiguration.java[BatchAutoConfiguration] and {spring-batch-api}/core/configuration/annotation/EnableBatchProcessing.html[@EnableBatchProcessing] for more details.



[[howto.batch.running-from-the-command-line]]
=== Running from the Command Line
Spring Boot converts any command line argument starting with `--` to a property to add to the `Environment`, see <<features#features.external-config.command-line-args,accessing command line properties>>.
This should not be used to pass arguments to batch jobs.
To specify batch arguments on the command line, use the regular format (that is without `--`), as shown in the following example:

[source,shell,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
	$ java -jar myapp.jar someParameter=someValue anotherParameter=anotherValue
----

If you specify a property of the `Environment` on the command line, it is ignored by the job.
Consider the following command:

[source,shell,indent=0,subs="verbatim"]
----
	$ java -jar myapp.jar --server.port=7070 someParameter=someValue
----

This provides only one argument to the batch job: `someParameter=someValue`.



[[howto.batch.storing-job-repository]]
=== Storing the Job Repository
Spring Batch requires a data store for the `Job` repository.
If you use Spring Boot, you must use an actual database.
Note that it can be an in-memory database, see {spring-batch-docs}job.html#configuringJobRepository[Configuring a Job Repository].

[[howto.batch.customizing-task-executor]]
=== Customizing the TaskExecutor for Batch Jobs

By default, jobs are run on the same thread they are launched on.
See {spring-batch-api}/core/configuration/annotation/EnableBatchProcessing.html[the Javadoc of `@EnableBatchProcessing`] for details.
Depending on your type of application, web applications in particular, this might be undesirable because the starting thread is blocked while the batch job runs.
Furthermore, additional jobs might have to wait for the currently running job to complete.
In such a case, it is necessary to customize the `TaskExecutor` used by Spring Batch.
